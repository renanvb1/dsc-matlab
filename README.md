matlab scripts developed during my doctorate studies

The scripts available in this repository consist of several matlab applications that were developed to solve some problems that I studied during my doctorate at applied mathematics. 
The main goal of each script is to solve a given problem, as clearly as possible, considering the restrictions imposed by the physical model employed. Code readibility was also an important guideline, as well as the easiness of interpreting the results provided by each script. Computational efficiency, on the other hand, was not a major issue.
For this reason, in many cases there might be more efficient ways to perform the same computations.
Some scripts require functions (.m files) that are also available in this repository.
